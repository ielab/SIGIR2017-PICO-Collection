# SIGIR2017 SysRev Query Collection

This repository contains the collection of queries for the paper "A Test Collection for Evaluating Retrieval of Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews".

**Update September 2023:** Variants of this collection (i.e., different topic sets used in papers) can now be found in the [variants](variants) directory. 

The following files have been made available:

 - `systematic_reviews.json`: A list of urls pointing to the systematic reviews used in this collection.
 - `citations.json`: A list of citations that correspond to the systematic reviews. The `document_id` refers to the `id` in `systematic_reviews.json`. The `included` field is true if the study was included in the review.
 - `queries_unannotated.json`: A list of queries as they appear in their respective systematic reviews. The `document_id` refers to the `id` in `systematic_reviews.json`. The `annotator_id` refers to who collected the query.
 - `queries_annotated.json`: A list of queries that have been manually transformed. The `document_id` refers to the `id` in `systematic_reviews.json`. The `annotator_id` refers to who annotated the query with PICO.
 - `queries_elastic_bool.json` and `queries_elastic_pico.json`: Both files are lists of Elasticsearch queries in the same format as `queries_annotated.json`.
