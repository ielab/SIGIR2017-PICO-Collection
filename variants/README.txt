This test collection has been used for a couple of papers, but some papers use different variations of topics (mostly due to technical limitations at the time when converting the queries to elasticsearch, or that the collection actually has queries in multiple query languages and we wanted to control for that).

The folders in this folder are named after how many topics there are in these variants. There is also a small explanation of the variation and a paper in which this variation was used.

If you still find any discrepancies in these variations, please let me know and I will do my best to fix them!
